This project applies Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to uncover the thematic structure of Gabriel García Márquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude. Using a Bag of Words (BoW) representation, the text was processed to identify eight distinct topics, including themes of magical realism, political unrest, and family dynamics. The results are visualized with PyLDAVis, providing an interactive representation of topic distributions and their most relevant terms. This analysis highlights the novel's narrative complexity and demonstrates the utility of topic modeling for exploring literary texts and beyond. The dataset was sourced from a GitHub repository, and the project includes both code and outputs for replicability and further exploration.
